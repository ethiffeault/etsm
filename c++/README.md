# c++ etsm
Tiny state machine for c++, see [etsm](https://github.com/ethiffeault/etsm)

# Description
Implement a bare bones state machine in many languages. This library aim to be simple as possible and support only basic features: 

- states on object (owner)
- optional enter/exit methods
- virtual state user methods
- is in
- unrestricted transitions
- no runtime allocation

# Install

```cpp
  #include <etsm.h>
```  
# Example

## Simple

Output: \
Sample: [ab](https://github.com/ethiffeault/etsm/tree/main/c%2B%2B/sample/ab)

## Virtual State Methods

Output: \
Sample: [virtual_call](https://github.com/ethiffeault/etsm/tree/main/c%2B%2B/sample/virtual_call)
